# STREAMLIT CLOUD SECRETS CONFIGURATION
# For Streamlit Cloud deployment only - add these through the app settings UI
# Go to: https://share.streamlit.io -> Your App -> Settings -> Secrets

# LOCAL DEVELOPMENT:
# - Your local .streamlit/secrets.toml already uses "authenticator = externalbrowser"
# - This allows SSO authentication when running locally
# - The .streamlit/secrets.toml file is in .gitignore and won't be committed

# STREAMLIT CLOUD DEPLOYMENT:
# - Copy the [snowflake] section below into your app's secrets
# - You MUST use password authentication (externalbrowser doesn't work in cloud)
# - Replace "your_snowflake_password_here" with your actual password

[snowflake]
account = "URHWEIA-HPSNZ"
user = "SAM.BREMER@HPSNZ.ORG.NZ"

# Use password authentication for Streamlit Cloud
password = "your_snowflake_password_here"

role = "PUBLIC"
warehouse = "COMPUTE_WH"
database = "CONSUME"
schema = "SMARTABASE"

# DEPLOYMENT STEPS:
# 1. Go to https://share.streamlit.io
# 2. Click on your app
# 3. Click "Settings" (gear icon) 
# 4. Go to "Secrets" section
# 5. Paste the [snowflake] section above with your real password
# 6. Save and redeploy

# NOTE: The app automatically detects which environment it's in:
# - Local: Uses "authenticator = externalbrowser" from your local secrets
# - Cloud: Uses "password" from cloud secrets
